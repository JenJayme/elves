            <strong>Elves On Call</strong> is a community service and fundraiser organized by San Jose Middle School PTA, a registered 501c3 nonprofit organization with a mission to enrich the lives of students and families.
            </p>

            <p>
            San Jose Middle School is one of only three public middle schools in Novato.  The school and serves young people in grades 6-8, and plays a vital role in helping Novato children grow into young adults.  Despite a home in beautiful and affluent Marin, SJMS is a Title 1 school with over 50% of families considered financially disadvantaged, and 40 students experiencing homelessness at last count.
            </p>

            <p>
            SJMS parents and students are volunteering to provide gift-wrapping as a holiday fundraiser and community service for busy parents.  Our services are open to the whole Novato community.  We simply ask for a donation that fits your means.  Your gift will directly support families facing financial hardship this holiday.
            </p>
            
            <p>In tandem with gift-wrapping, we are running a Holiday Gift Drive for families in need. Our goals are to spread holiday cheer, joyfully take the gift-wrapping work off the shoulders of busy parents, and raise funds to benefit families facing financial hardship.  We work directly with school administrators and teachers to identify youth in need.
            </p>

            The enterprise was started by a crafty 12-year-old entrepreneur, Cole Jayme, Chief Elf. Cole loves Christmas. He also loves to wrap presents and has an unusual talent for it. Since learning 
            some secrets about Santa Clause, he loves helping to make Christmas magical for others.  Cole wraps gifts with his unique creative flair, recruits friends and parents to assist, and helps manage quality control.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Elves on Call is also supported by Cole's mom, Jen Jayme, who is PTA President at San Jose Middle School, and an entrepreneur and web developer, along with a strong team of PTA Board leaders and volunteers.
