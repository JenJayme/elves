            <strong>Elves On Call</strong> is a small local family business led by a crafty 12-year-old entrepreneur, Cole Jayme.
            </p><p>  
            Cole loves Christmas.  He also loves to wrap presents and has an unusual talent for it.  Since learning 
            some secrets about Santa Clause last year, and earning his first pocket money doing odd jobs for neighbors, he has mobilized to 
            help make Christmas magical.  Cole does the hard work of wrapping gifts for Elves On Call, recruiting friends to assist 
            as needed, and leads and markets the business.  
            </p><p>
            The enterprise is supported by Cole's mom, Jen Jayme, under her consulting practice <a href="https://jaymedev.com/">Jayme Development Services</a>, 
            which provides marketing and web support for small businesses and nonprofits.  Jen hopes to nurture 
            Cole's entrepreneurial spirit while building her web portfolio, and making the holidays easier for other moms. 
            We live in Novato and serve people in northern Marin County from San Rafael to Petaluma. It's a family project and a labor of love.
            </p><p>
            A portion of all proceeds will be donated to St. Vincent de Paul Society to help people experiencing homelessness, along with a donation from our family.  
            </p>
            <p>
            We recognize the importance of safety precautions to stop the spread of COVID, and have incorporated sterilizing into our procedures 
            to keep our family and yours safe. 
            </p><p>
            Thanks for your support.  We hope we can bring a little magic and convenience to your life!
            </p>
