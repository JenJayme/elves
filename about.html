            <strong>Elves On Call</strong> is a youth-led enterprise to benefit San Jose Middle School PTA, a registered 501c3 nonprofit with a mission to enrich the lives of SJMS students and families.
            </p>

            <p>
            We volunteer to provide gift-wrapping services as a fundraiser, and run a Holiday Gift Drive for families in need in our community. Our goals are to spread holiday cheer, joyfully take the gift-wrapping work off the shoulders of busy parents, and raise funds to benefit SJMS families.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The enterprise is led by a crafty 12-year-old entrepreneur, Cole Jayme, Chief Elf. Cole loves Christmas. He also loves to wrap presents and has an unusual talent for it. Since learning 
            some secrets about Santa Clause, he loves helping to make Christmas magical for others.  Cole does the hard work of wrapping gifts for Elves On Call, recruits SJMS students and parents to assist, and brings his creative flair to oversee gift-wrap quality control.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The enterprise is also supported by Cole's mom, Jen Jayme, who is PTA President at San Jose Middle School, and an entrepreneur and web developer, along with a strong team of PTA Board leaders and volunteers. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We work directly with school staff to identify students and families in need. Most gifts will be wrapped during <strong>The Big Wrap</strong> on <strong>Sunday, December 19th</strong>.  Gifts can be dropped off and picked up at SJMS from <strong>10:00am to 6:00pm</strong>. All proceeds will go to San Jose Middle School PTA to benefit students facing financial hardship.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We recognize the importance of safety precautions to stop the spread of COVID, and have incorporated sterilizing into our procedures 
            to keep our family and yours safe. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Thanks for your support.  We hope we can bring a little magic and convenience to your life!
            </p>
