This website was built to establish a presence on the web for a youth-led holiday gift-wrapping business which donates a portion of proceeds to charity.  In addition to designing and building the pages, I purchased the domain for them  (elvesoncall.com) and created an A record in the DNS settings to serve the site from my GitHub Page.
